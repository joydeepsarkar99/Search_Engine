# Search_Engine
 Experience the ultimate search journey with my fully functional DFS-driven search engine "QUEST", revolutionizing the way you explore the web.🚀

➡️ A search engine is a powerful tool that enables users to find information and other content on the internet. In this project, we aim to build a simple search engine from scratch and gain a deeper understanding of how it functions behind the scenes. The search engine will utilize Term Frequencies (TFs) in its web crawling process using indexer, enabling efficient data retrieval.

➡️ Technologies used in this project include :
• Front-end : HTML,CSS,JSP
• Back-end : Java Servlets
• Database : MySQL
• Other Technologies used - IntelliJ IDEA, Maven Archetype, Tomcat Server, JDBC(ConnectorJ)

➡️ The primary components of our search engine project are the front end, back end, and database. 
• The front end is responsible for the user interface, where users can interact with the search engine through a search bar and search button.
• The back end handles the server-side operations, processing user requests and generating appropriate responses.
• The database stores and manages the data that the search engine will use to retrieve relevant results.

➡️ The front-end design includes a web application with a simple search bar and a search button. When users input their queries and click the search button, the back end processes the search request and retrieves the top 30 results using Ranking Algorithm based on the user's query. The search history of users is also displayed, allowing them to keep track of their previous searches.

➡️ The search engine will follow the client-server model, where the front end (client) sends requests to the back end (server), which processes these requests and generates appropriate responses. This relationship can be likened to a customer interacting with a waiter in a restaurant, where the customer places an order, and the waiter conveys it to the kitchen (back end) for preparation.

➡️ A significant part of the project involves implementing a web crawler. A web crawler is a bot that automatically navigates through web pages, retrieving data to populate the database used by the search engine. The web crawler uses an algorithm called Limited Depth-First Search (DFS) to crawl through web pages systematically.

➡️ With the project's web application design, web crawler implementation, and database setup, we aim to create an efficient search engine that can retrieve relevant search results based on user queries and provide a seamless user experience.
